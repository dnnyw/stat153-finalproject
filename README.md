# STAT 153 Time Series Analysis - Spring 2021 Final Project
 Covid Case prediction project for the Spring 2021 iteration of STAT 153 at UC Berkeley taught by Professor Jared Fisher. 
 
 Used parametric and differencing models to detrend data, then fitted SARIMA models in order to model the underlying random noise to make predictions. 
 
 Predicted results on simulated data had on average a 10% margin of error (roughly 10,000 cases).
